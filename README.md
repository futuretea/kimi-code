## What is Tea Code CLI

Tea Code CLI is an AI coding agent that runs in your terminal — it can read and edit code, run shell commands, search files, fetch web pages, and choose the next step based on the feedback it receives. It works out of the box with Moonshot AI’s Kimi models and can also be configured to use other compatible providers.

## Install

Requires Node.js 22.19.0 or later. Install with npm:

```sh
npm install -g @futuretea/tea-code
tea-code --version
```

On Windows, install Git for Windows; custom Git Bash paths still use `KIMI_SHELL_PATH`.

Tea Code 0.4.0 corresponds to Kimi Code 0.41.0. User state lives in `TEA_CODE_HOME` or `~/.tea-code`, independently of upstream installations. The browser Web UI retains Kimi Code branding.

## Quick Start

Open a project and start the interactive UI:

```sh
cd your-project
tea-code
```

On first launch, run `/login` inside Tea Code CLI and choose either Kimi Code OAuth or a Moonshot AI Open Platform API key. After login, try your first task:

```
Take a look at this project and explain its main directories.
```

## Key Features

- **npm distribution.** Install the `tea-code` command independently of upstream Kimi Code.
- **Blazing-fast startup.** The TUI is ready in milliseconds, so starting a session never feels heavy.
- **Purpose-built TUI.** A carefully tuned interface, optimized end to end for long, focused agent sessions.
- **Video input.** Drop a screen recording or demo clip into the chat and let the agent watch what is hard to describe in words — turn a reference clip into a LUT, a long video into a short, a screen recording into working code, and more.
- **AI-native MCP configuration.** Add, edit, and authenticate Model Context Protocol servers conversationally with `/mcp-config`, without hand-editing JSON.
- **Rich plugin ecosystem.** Install skills, MCP servers, and data sources from the marketplace or any GitHub repo, with each install's trust level surfaced up front.
- **Subagents for focused, parallel work.** Dispatch built-in `coder`, `explore`, and `plan` subagents in isolated contexts while keeping the main conversation clean.
- **Lifecycle hooks.** Run local commands at key points to gate risky tool calls, audit decisions, trigger desktop notifications, or connect to your own automation.
- **Editor & IDE integration (ACP).** Drive a Tea Code CLI session straight from Zed, JetBrains, or any [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) client with `tea-code acp`.

## Use it in your editor (ACP)

Tea Code CLI speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/), so ACP-compatible editors and IDEs (Zed, JetBrains, …) can drive a session over stdio. Log in once, then point your editor at the `tea-code acp` subcommand — no extra login needed.

For Zed, add this to `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Tea Code CLI": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "tea-code",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Then open a new conversation in Zed's Agent panel. See [Using in IDEs](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code/en/guides/ides) for JetBrains setup and troubleshooting, and the [`tea-code acp` reference](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code/en/reference/kimi-acp) for the full capability matrix.
